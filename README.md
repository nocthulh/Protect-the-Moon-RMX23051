# Protect-the-Moon-RMX23051
 This is a reversion of the 'protect the moon' project for the initial O3DE tutorial, in which I created a project from scratch for learning purposes, and I will take the opportunity to document certain discrepancies of the new version 23.05.1, You can obtain the original project that contains the assets from here: https://github.com/o3de/Protect-the-moon.

Below, I'm sharing a blog that outlines the various changes I made to the project for better readability and organization.

## restructuring of the asset tree

I made this change simply to organize the navigation provided by the content browser, turning characters into unique directories, which resembles the organization of the entity's components

## Modify the Assets for fun

- Include multiple materials in the FBX file from Blender and import the .Blend file into the project. ![newthrees](https://github.com/nocthulh/Protect-the-Moon-RMX23051/blob/main/README.img/RayGun_MM.png)
