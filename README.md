# Protect-the-Moon-RMX23051
 This is a reversion of the 'protect the moon' project for the initial O3DE tutorial, in which I created a project from scratch for learning purposes, and I will take the opportunity to document certain discrepancies of the new version 23.05.1, You can obtain the original project that contains the assets from here: https://github.com/o3de/Protect-the-moon.

Below, I'm sharing a blog that outlines the various changes I made to the project for better readability and organization.
